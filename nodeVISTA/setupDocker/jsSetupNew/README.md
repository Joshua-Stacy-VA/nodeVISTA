# JS (MVDM-based) Setup of VISTA

All but initialization of User/Patient and FM and Taskman initialization (done in Roll and Scroll PY). Plan to move Patient and User to JS too.

Draws on http://www.hardhats.org/projects/New/InitializeVistA.html for basic System setup

__9/19 Note__: so far ONLY _system_ contents used. JSSetup(Old) used for everything else
