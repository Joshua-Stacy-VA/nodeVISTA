need node.js command line, simple examples like a "VPR invoker", "vitals adder", "prescription order adder" etc.

These show and test that:

  * raw node access works for all required functions BEFORE VDM neatens on top and VDMN on top of that.
  * tests what can be used under VDM: it may not be possible to use FM insert calls (UPDATE^DIE) but need to try.
