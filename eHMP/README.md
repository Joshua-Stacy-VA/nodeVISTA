## eHMP Selections 

The published eHMP code ([OSEHRA Download](http://code.osehra.org/journal/journal/view/519)) lacks documentation and the directory layouts have a "insider, narrow-use, 
in-house" feel. Rather than copy the full eHMP code here, we're taking relevant pieces and putting them into a directory layout suitable for the Project.
