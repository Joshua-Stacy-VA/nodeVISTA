# nodeVISTA

The Project calls for the development of a test VISTA system ("_nodeVISTA_"). nodeVISTA will be based on OSEHRA's Vagrant VISTA, refined to meet Project requirements.

The Project will build a series of datasets for nodeVISTA to suit different demonstrations and tests, some of which will come from or be inspired by the VISTA systems furnished by the government.
