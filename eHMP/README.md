## eHMP Selections 

The published eHMP code ([OSEHRA Download](http://code.osehra.org/journal/journal/view/519)) lacks documentation and the directory layouts have a "insider, narrow-use, 
in-house" feel. Rather than copy the full eHMP code here, we're taking relevant pieces and putting them into a directory layout suitable for the Project.

What is here: ... fill in
  * test code, focus on write-back which is RPC (direct to VISTA) centric
  * ...

ie/ not putting in JDS and its MUMPS/Javascript etc as VistA Data will go "direct to VistA". By extension sync isn't interesting either

What is NOT here:
  * HMP UI
  * JDS and Sync code
  * the HMP copy of the VPR RPC (TODO: do formal comparison)
  * ...
