# nodeVISTA

The Project calls for a test and demo VISTA system ("_nodeVISTA_"). _nodeVISTA_ is not a new distribution of VISTA. It is not an alternative to _osehraVISTA_ or _worldVISTA_ or to other efforts that involve Node.js and VISTA. It is a basic OSEHRA (or FOIA) VISTA configured for a demo hospital used by VDP and related projects.
