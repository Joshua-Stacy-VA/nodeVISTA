# nodeVistA

Deliverable 25 introduces the FileMan Test VISTA, defined as a “VISTA FileMan, populated to allow testing of all service nuance”. Deliverables 24 and 30 also explicitly call for its use and such a system would be needed for all of these proofs of concepts other than Deliverable 26 and 32. The FileMan Test VISTA is not government furnished equipment. This system and its datasets is a “supporting deliverable” just like the project repository and web site and must be created early on in the project.
