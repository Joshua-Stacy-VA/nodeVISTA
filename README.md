# nodeVISTA

The Project calls for the assembly of a test VISTA system ("_nodeVISTA_"). _nodeVISTA_ is based on OSEHRA's Vagrant VISTA. 

_nodeVISTA_ is not a new distribution of VISTA. It is not an alternative to _osehraVISTA_ or _worldVISTA_ or to other efforts that involve Node.js and VISTA. It is a __refined packaging honed for our mission, to provide a Node.js-enabled, secure read-write model for VISTA__.
