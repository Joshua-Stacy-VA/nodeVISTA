## Cache VistA Resource directory

For a clean VistA Cache installation, you should put the following files in here:
* **Required** RHEL 64-bit Cache install package
* _Optional_ Cache license key, if you have it
* _Optional_ CACHE.DAT file if you'd like to use a specific exported Cache instance. If none present, the installer scripts will install a fresh copy of VistA from the OSEHRA FOIA archive
