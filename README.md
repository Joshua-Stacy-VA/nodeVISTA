# nodeVISTA

The Project calls for a test and demo VISTA system based on Node.js ("_nodeVISTA_"). _nodeVISTA_ is not a new distribution of VISTA. It is not an alternative to _osehraVISTA_ or _worldVISTA_ or to other efforts that involve Node.js and VISTA.  It is a FOIA VISTA configured for a demonstration hospital used by the VistA Data Project and related projects.

* [nodeVISTA RPC Services](https://github.com/vistadataproject/nodeVISTA/tree/master/rpcServer#rpc-server)


__Note__: As of September 2018, _nodeVISTA_ has become a reconfiguration of FOIA VISTA exclusively. In addition, this reconfiguration uses (only) the VistA Data Model (VDM) module.
