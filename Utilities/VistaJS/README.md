From eHMP release made available by OSEHRA. 

VistaJS: a Javascript equivalent to various RPC Broker client side libraries in Python (in FMQL) and Java (in MDWS). 

Note: __not node.js Vista.js__ - a separate project to provide a node.js module for node on VistA. There's a lot of unfortunate name reuse in VistA now. _VPR_ is reused for the mid-tier eHMP Data store and as an RPC on VistA.
