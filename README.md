# nodeVistA

The project necessitates the development of a test VISTA system (“FileMan Test VISTA”) to allow testing of these proofs of concept. The FileMan Test VISTA is not government furnished equipment.

The Team will base FileMan Test VISTA on OSEHRA’s Vagrant VISTA which will be evolved to meet Project requirements. The Team will build a series of datasets for FileMan Test VISTA to suit different demonstrations and tests, some of which will come from or be inspired by the VISTA systems furnished by the government.
