# nodeVISTA

The Project calls for a test VISTA system ("_nodeVISTA_"). _nodeVISTA_ is based on OSEHRA's Vagrant-based VISTA which was assembled by [Chris Edwards](https://www.osehra.org/blog/automated-vista-installation-and-testing-using-vagrant). 

_nodeVISTA_ is not a new distribution of VISTA. It is not an alternative to _osehraVISTA_ or _worldVISTA_ or to other efforts that involve Node.js and VISTA. It is 

> a VISTA packaging based on osehraVISTA, honed for our mission to provide a Node.js-enabled, secure read-write model for VISTA.
