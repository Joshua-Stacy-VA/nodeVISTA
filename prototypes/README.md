Unlike _nodemExamples_, these Node.js based scripts have a specific purpose in mind. For example, a "vitals.js" to try out CRUD of vitals for VISTA.

__Note:__ prototypes are not finished Node.js modules. They tease out the particulars of _create-read-update-delete_ of VISTA data using FileMan updates, RPC invocations and evne direct global writes. The do's, don'ts, what's possible's and what's not that prototypes establish will feed the clean VDM and MVDM implementations.
